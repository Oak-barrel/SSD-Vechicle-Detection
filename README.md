# SSD-Vechicle-Detection
The motivation of this project is to build a more reliable vehicle detection system. The [basic vehicle detection](https://github.com/jiajuns/VehicleDetectionBasic) is pretty bad, then let's see how deep learning model can help. To summarize this repo is to build Single-Shot-MultiBox-Detector on [Udacity Vehicle dataset](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car/tree/master/annotations) to create a fast deep learning vechicle tracking system
